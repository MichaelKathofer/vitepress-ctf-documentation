## Defining pages
### Sign in / Register
To manage access control, enable login from different devices and assign data to their users.

### Dashboard
Helps users track the progress: How many challenges theyâ€™ve completed,
the number of lessons left in the current course, learning streaks and others.
It, therefore, provides an overview of all challenges with each status.

### Leaderboard
Provides an overall ranking to show users their positioning compared to other participants.

### Question page
Tells the user the task and provides an input field for the flag after the challenge has been solved.
It also provides the option for hints if users get stuck.
