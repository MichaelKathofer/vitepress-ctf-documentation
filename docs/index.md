# CTF Report Page

This page is dedicated to the documentation of a VIVES University Final Year CTF project by Michael Kathofer.


# Introduction

This project aims to build a CTF learning platform. **CTF** stands for **C**apture **t**he **F**lag and is a well-known
formate in cybersecurity competitions. The objective for participants is to enter in flags, which are embedded within
each challenge. The scoring system is based on how long it takes to enter the flag, and also how many hints they
requested.
This concept forms the basis for this Project.
