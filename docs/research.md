## Quiz Library
jQuizzy

While doing research, I concluded, that Quiz Library wouldn't be a good fit for this project.
They don't feel that substantial and go in other directions in terms of the overall goal of the application.

## Result
The basis for this project is formed by CTFd. It convinces with good customizable and an already big set of features
that match our previously defined must-haves and should-haves.
