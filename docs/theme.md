# Design
The goal is to have a custom theme for the CTFd framework that is directly tailored towards the corporate design of
VIVES University.

## Iteration 1

### Components
#### Logo
With the input and analysis of the current VIVES homepage I designed a logo for this CTF project:

## Iteration 2
The goal of this Iteration was to make the Styling more professional. The first design was to plain and didn't seem to
be inviting enough. Therefore, I tried to make the Landingpage more colorful and playful, while keeping it professional.
As a design language I choose the style of "Kurzgesagt": Colourful svg with reduced detailing and shapes. The fist step
was to rethink the overall Theme. Capture the Flag and moonlanding felt like a good idea after a lot of brainstorming.
The reason being, that I can make the styling darker because of the dark sky, and I can implement the Vives red as the 
surface of a planet. 

#### Section design 1
This is the transition between the first section with the hero image, and the second one with the explaining video.
